# Diverse Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Tackling the Classic Rocket Trajectory Problem

# Description
In this repository we implemented an agent that is trained to play the game lunar lander using i) DQN algorithm, and ii) a (double) deep Q-learning algorithm utilizing Jax and Haiku frameworks.

# Lunar Lander Environment
starting state  
In every episode, the rocket starts from a consistent position, precisely at the top center of the view-port.

Observation Space  
encompasses eight state variables:
the lander‚Äôs horizontal position (x-coordinate), the lander‚Äôs vertical position (y-coordinate), horizontal
velocity (vx), vertical velocity (vy), orientation in space (Œ∏), angular velocity (ùíò), whether the left
leg is touching the ground (Boolean) and whether the right leg is touching the ground (Boolean).

Actions
There are 4 actions within this environment:

‚Ä¢ 0: Taking no action    
‚Ä¢ 1: Activating the left orientation engine  
‚Ä¢ 2: Activating the main engine  
‚Ä¢ 3: Activating the right orientation engine

# Goal
maintaining an average score of 200 points or greater over a span of 200 consecutive landing attempts.

# Findings
DDQN outperforms the DQN as expected
